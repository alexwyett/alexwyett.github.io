So...hello! This is my first step into the wonderful world of the blogging so please forgive me if this isn't the most fluent of blog posts.

To be honest, in this post there isn't much for you to see.  This will serve me more than it will you as I'll be testing some of the neat features that [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) provide.
